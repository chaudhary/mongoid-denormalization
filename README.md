# Mongoid::Denormalization

Helper module for denormalizing association attributes in Mongoid models & embedded models.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mongoid-denormalization'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mongoid-denormalization

## Usage

In your model:
```ruby
# Include the helper method
include Mongoid::Denormalization

# Define your denormalization
denormalize_from(:user, :name) # this will add a user_name field on your model
denormalize_from(:user, :email) # this will add a user_email field on your model
```

Optionally, you can also write it as
```ruby
# this will add a username field on your model
denormalize_from(:user, :name, :denormalized_field_name => :username)

# this will add a useremail field on your model
denormalize_from(:user, :email, :denormalized_field_name => :useremail)
```

Lets say we have a company model with embedded jobs in it. We want to denormalize user_name and user_email in jobs.
We can write the following code in our jobs model:

```ruby
denormalize_from(:user, :name, to_klass_infos: [{
  klasses: [::Company],
  selector_proc: Proc.new do |id, value|
    {:jobs => {"$elemMatch" => {:user_id => id, :user_name => {"$ne" => value}}}}
  end,
  updator: "jobs.$.user_name",
  index_key: "jobs.user_id"
}])

denormalize_from(:user, :email, to_klass_infos: [{
  klasses: [::Company],
  selector_proc: Proc.new do |id, value|
    {:jobs => {"$elemMatch" => {:user_id => id, :user_email => {"$ne" => value}}}}
  end,
  updator: "jobs.$.user_email",
  index_key: "jobs.user_id"
}])
```

You can call force_denormalize also,
```ruby
company.force_denormalize # this will simply sync all the denormalized fields and will not triiger a save on document.
company.force_denormalize! # this will sync all the denormalized fields and will also triiger a save on document.
```

Note: you should also create proper db indexes required, otherwise the module may through an error.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
